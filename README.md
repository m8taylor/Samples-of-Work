# Samples-of-Work

Here are some samples of code I've written.

# Datagather.py scrapes a webpage and sends the scraped data to a SQL database

# Share.py and Follow.py can be used to interface with webpages, without utilizing Selenium

    Alarm.py sets off an alarm if something goes wrong.  This helps to catch bugs.
    
    To utilize these files, set your screen resolution to 1366 x 768 and open Firefox.  Make sure your developer console is docked right and has its leftmost edge at x = 850.

# GatherDataOld.py was one of the *main* files I use for html parsing.

    DataParserOld.py extracts and returns html data.

    WordSortBegin.py extracts and returns keywords from urls.

# These files prepare csv files for use with machine learning and importing to MySQL.

    CSVRowReduced.py reduces the number of rows in a csv file.

    RowToColumn.py transposes the rows and columns in a csv file.

RandomSample.csv contains a random sample of sales data I scraped.  I was preparing to feed it into an ML model.  However, I decided to collect a much larger sample before using ML because there are lots of keywords in the urls and lots of brands.
